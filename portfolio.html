    <h2>Capstone Research Project</h2>
    
    <h3> During my Senior Year at UVA, I conducted a Capstone Research on the Socio-technical Implications of “Machine Learning for E-commerce 
        and Transportation.” I learned that tech companies need to streamline their production schedule, improve their apps for autonomous 
        vehicles, and ensure their apps and autonomous vehicles are ready for e-commerce so that customers can wholeheartedly embrace AI and 
        machine learning in their vehicles. Completing capstone research has enabled me to develop critical thinking, research, and problem-solving skills. </h3>

        <h2>NASA Project</h2>



    <h3> I took a NASA six months course in engineering. I successfully completed it, and as a result, NASA invited me to Wallops. 
        I had the opportunity to meet astronauts, work with other students, and learn about hydraulics and rockets. In one of the 
        assignments, I had to design a model rocket to launch. </h3>
